  <h2>Who Am I ?</h2>

  <p> My name is Arfa Chowdhary(she/her) I recently transferred to CU
  and this is my first semester on campus. I like to keep myself busy by exploring different
  parks, boutiques, and coffee shops. I also enjoy drawing, crocheting, listening to music, going on walks, and spending time with
  people. Lately, I've been having a lot of fun decorating my new house with my roommates.
