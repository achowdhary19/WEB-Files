document.getElementById("chew").addEventListener("click", myFunction);

// Why does it default to getElements? And why wont it work to use the class id? ok i got it to work with class id but why do i need a number. maybe i should change it to image id so that the lcicking is specific 

function myFunction() {
  alert ("Hello World!");
}
