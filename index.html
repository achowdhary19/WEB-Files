    <h3>What is needlepointing? </h3>
    <p>Needlepointing is a type of embroidery worked on an even-weave canvas. Normal embroidery differs 
        from needlepointing in that uses a soft cloth and requires an embroidery hoop. One can stitch the canvas free
        hand or find a canvas that has a design already painted on it. This type of canvas work began when ancient Egyptians used small
        slanted stitches to sew their canvas tents.  </p>
