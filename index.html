<p> My name is Arfa Chowdhary(she/her) I recently transferred to CU
and this is my first semester on campus. I like to keep myself busy by exploring different
parks, boutiques, and coffee shops. I also enjoy, crocheting, cooking, listening to music, doodling, going on walks, and spending time with
people. Lately, I've been having a lot of fun decorating my new house with my roommates.
